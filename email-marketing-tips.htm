		of what product or service is on offer. It is much cheaper than other 
		kinds of advertizing. Moreover, it is good for building trust between 
		your customers and you. As a result, your sales will increase and you 
		will make more profit.<p><br>
		The basis of email marketing is a targeted, 
		voluntary mailing list. If you have a list of subscribers who trust you 
		and consider you an expert in a specific area, you are on the right 
		path.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Here are some <b>tips</b> to help you make and extend your mailing list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Provide useful, relevant, unique content</b>. Users won’t subscribe 
			just because your subscription is free of charge. You must provide 
			unique, valuable information, which will be useful to your 
			subscribers.</li>
			<li><b>Place the subscription form where it can be easily seen</b>. It must 
			be easily accessible, not hidden in the bottom of some unimportant 
			page of your site. If you have a blog, the sidebar is the best place 
			for the subscription form.</li>
			<li><b>Make the subscription process as simple as possible</b>. Do not make 
			too many mandatory fields, or risk losing potential subscribers! In 
			most cases, the subscriber’s name and email address will be enough.</li>
			<li><b>Personalize the subscription process</b>. The percentage of 
			subscription confirmations will increase considerably if the users 
			who filled the subscription form are redirected to a webpage where 
			they are addressed by name.</li>
			<li><b>Be sure to note that all subscriber data are confidential</b>! Many 
			users worry that they may become an easy target of spammers if they 
			subscribe to some mailing list. Explain to your potential 
			subscribers that you guarantee full confidentiality of their data. 
			It’s advisable to make a special page describing your 
			confidentiality policy and put a link to this page below the 
			subscription form.</li>
			<li><b>Be sincere, persuasive, and honest about what users will get if 
			they subscribe to your mailing list.</b></li>
			<li><b>Show an example of your direct email to your site or blog 
			visitors</b>. By doing that, you will let your potential subscribers get 
			acquainted with your mailing list before subscribing and take an 
			informed decision.</li>
			<li><b>Tell the people about the frequency of your direct emails</b>. Do 
			not flood your subscribers with too many messages!</li>
			<li><b>Make an archive of your mailing list at your website</b>. Such an 
			archive, containing all issues of your mailing list, may be one more 
			reason for potential users to subscribe. Moreover, it will help you 
			generate additional search traffic for your site.</li>
			<li><b>Contact other mailing list authors</b>. Let them know that you are 
			willing to mention their mailing lists in your direct emails if they 
			agree to do the same for you. It will help both you and other 
			authors to increase the number of subscribers in less time.</li>
			<li><b>Be sure to offer useful freebies</b>! Write a book or make a report 
			in the PDF format, and promise to give that freebie to each user who 
			subscribes to your mailing list.</li>
			<li><b>Offer discounts</b> for your products or services to every 
			subscriber.</li>
			<li><b>Ask your subscribers to tell other people about your mailing 
			list</b>. Word of mouth is a very effective kind of advertizing, which 
			works greatly for email marketing. If your subscribers consider your 
			content useful and informative, they will be happy to share it with 
			their friends and acquaintances. In this way, you can get a lot of 
			new subscribers.</li>
			<li><b>Add a subscription link to your email signature</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Add a Subscribe button to your direct emails</b>. If you use plain 
			text (not HTML) format in your email messages, add a link to the 
			subscription webpage. It may seem unnecessary (because the user is 
			already subscribed to your mailing list), but keep in mind that your 
			subscribers will be forwarding some issues to their friends or 
			acquaintances. So it makes sense to make the subscription process as 
			easy as possible.</li>
			<li><b>Create a special page for subscription</b>. The separate page for 
			subscribing to your mailing list should be intended for that purpose 
			only. It must have a persuasive header and list all advantages to 
			make your visitors want to subscribe immediately. After creating 
			that page, find out the most popular keywords and run contextual 
			ads.</li>
			<li><b>Remember to place user testimonials on your subscription page</b>. 
			It’s very important to do that! Place there some 2 or 3 opinions of 
			satisfied users. You can use testimonials in any format, though 
			multimedia (audio or video) formats usually make them more 
			trustworthy. People like to follow other people — that’s human 
			nature.<br>
