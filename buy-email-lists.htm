		<img border="0" src="email-list.jpg" width="207" height="210" alt="purchase email list" align="left">A lot of people would like to get a ready 
		<a href="email-lists.htm">list of email addresses</a>, which 
		can be used for direct mailing. Why spend months to collect email 
		addresses, if you can buy them for a reasonable sum?<p>But it’s not that 
		simple, and in most cases buying a list of addresses is a waste of 
		money. Let me explain the reason.</p>
		<p>Suppose some guy has collected a list of email addresses for his own 
		use; surely, he has acquired a very valuable resource! In this case, 
		email marketing will work great, because that guy has a list of persons 
		he can send messages to on a regular basis; it will help him increase 
		his sales, build trust, stimulate software downloads, etc.</p>
		<p>However, the value of such list may decrease if it’s misused. For 
		example, if you flood your subscribers with tons of ads, they may stop 
		replying to you or just unsubscribe. Besides, spam abuse complaints may 
		follow.</p>
		<p>As you can see, there is a good reason to value your mailing list. If 
		the list owner decides to let third parties send messages using that 
		list, he would surely want to control the process. Be warned that if 
		someone offers you an email list without any conditions, thousands of 
		other people may get that list too. The end user will be receiving 
		thousands of messages; naturally, no one is going to read all them, so 
		the effect from ads will be very small (if not zero).</p>
		<p>Therefore, if someone offers you a list of email addresses or 
		proposes to send direct emails on behalf of you, in 99 out of 100 cases 
		you will get a list of addresses flooded with spam.</p>
		<p>In the best case, the effect from your direct emails will be 
		negligent; in the worst, your site will be banned for spamming. Beware 
		of offers like “<b>1 million email addresses for $10</b>” — that’s just 
		another way to say goodbye to your money!</p>
		<p>It is much more effective to collect a list of email addresses on 
		your own by using a special program, so-called “<a href="/">email extractor</a>” (also 
		referred to as “<a href="email-grabber.htm">email grabber</a>”). Thanks to such software, you can create 
		targeted mailing lists by specifying keywords for searching or websites 
		for scanning.<br>
