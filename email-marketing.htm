		<img border="0" src="email-marketing.jpg" width="293" height="292" alt="email marketing" align="left">Email marketing</b> is a tool for promoting products or services through 
		email messages.<p>In general, email marketing consists of sending 
		messages to customers, prospective customers, or members of some 
		community. There are three kinds of email marketing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sending emails to attract new customers or convince existing 
			ones to buy your product again (direct advertizing);</li>
			<li>Sending emails to increase the loyalty of existing customers 
			(reinforcement advertising);</li>
			<li>Placing your advertisements in email messages sent by other 
			people.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Email marketing is very similar to conventional marketing, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Selling goods through mail order;</li>
			<li>Direct mailing of brochures, magazines,<br>
			or newspapers;</li>
			<li>Placing advertisements in magazines or newspapers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, there is an important difference. (I’ll tell you more about 
		it later.)</p>
		<p><b>Why Email Marketing is so Popular?</b></p>
		<p>Email marketing is very popular for the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Electronic mailing is much cheaper than other kinds of 
			advertising;</li>
			<li>Email lets you deliver information directly to your customers;</li>
			<li>Email marketing can be very effective if the right approach is 
			used.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let’s take a look at three types of email marketing:</p>
		<p><b>1. Direct Email Marketing</b></p>
		<p>Direct email marketing consists of sending email messages. For 
		example, you can send an announcement about a special offer (discount). 
		You can use your own list of email addresses of your customers or buy an 
		email list at a special web portal. The acquired email lists can help 
		you extend your customer base. By sending messages to you customers, you 
		can stimulate them to make repeat purchases. You can also lease email 
		lists from companies that allow others to send messages to addresses on 
		their lists. Besides, you can select email addresses for sending your 
		messages by using such criteria as the user’s geographic location.</p>
		<p><b>2. Reinforcement Electronic Mailing</b></p>
		<p>You can use email messages to retain your regular customers (instead 
		of using email marketing to stimulate the recipient to do something). 
		Electronic newsletters sent on a regular basis are mostly used for that 
		purpose. Though newsletters may contain promotional materials or 
		advertisements, they should focus on establishing long-term relations 
		with the customer. Therefore, such newsletters must not only contain 
		commercial information but also inform and entertain the reader.</p>
		<p><b>3. Advertisements in Other People’s Direct Emails</b></p>
		<p>Instead of making and supporting your own electronic mailing list, 
		you may want to find other people willing to take your money and place 
		your ads in their direct emails. Actually, there is a huge number of 
		electronic mailing lists created exactly for that purpose — selling 
		advertisement spots.</p>
		<p><b>Problems of Email Marketing</b></p>
		<p>In practice, it’s not that simple, beginning from the complexity of 
		creating a good message and ending with distribution of the message to 
		your target audience. You must also persuade the recipients to read your 
		message and to take some action. To do that, you have to measure and 
		analyze the results. And the most important problem is that of 
		legitimacy (also known as the “spam problem”).</p>
		<p>In fact, you must obtain an email address owner’s consent to 
		receiving your messages before you start sending your commercial emails 
		to that address. If you don’t have such consent, the recipients of your 
		emails may consider them as spam.</p>
		<p>If you are accused of sending spam, your email address may be blocked 
		and your website may be added to the black list (or even totally 
		banned). As a result, your reputation may suffer. In some countries, you 
		even may be prosecuted. Therefore, you should always ask your potential 
		subscribers for their consent to receiving your messages.</p>
		<p>It’s very important that everyone who is going to use email marketing 
		considers the issues of legality and spam. </p>
